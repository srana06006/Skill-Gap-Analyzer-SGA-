# 🧠 Skill-Gap Analyzer (SGA)

**Skill-Gap Analyzer (SGA)** is an AI-driven workforce analytics platform that pinpoints missing competencies in candidates or employees by analyzing three primary data sources — **résumés/CVs**, **job descriptions**, and **face-to-face interview performance**.  
It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to extract, match, and recommend the most efficient and affordable upskilling pathways.

Modern workplaces face a widening skill gap between what employers need and what candidates offer.  
SGA addresses this challenge by transforming unstructured data — from résumés, job postings, and interviews — into actionable insights.  
The platform not only highlights skill mismatches but also recommends personalized learning paths to bridge them.
