# üß† Skill-Gap Analyzer (SGA)

**Skill-Gap Analyzer (SGA)** is an AI-driven workforce analytics platform that pinpoints missing competencies in candidates or employees by analyzing three primary data sources ‚Äî **r√©sum√©s/CVs**, **job descriptions**, and **face-to-face interview performance**.  
It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to extract, match, and recommend the most efficient and affordable upskilling pathways.

## üåü Overview

Modern workplaces face a widening skill gap between what employers need and what candidates offer.  
SGA addresses this challenge by transforming unstructured data ‚Äî from r√©sum√©s, job postings, and interviews ‚Äî into actionable insights.  
The platform not only highlights skill mismatches but also recommends personalized learning paths to bridge them.

  Uses NLP models (spaCy, TF-IDF) to parse r√©sum√©s and job descriptions, identifying both explicit and implicit skills.

- **Competency Matching**  
  Quantifies alignment between a candidate‚Äôs skill profile and a job‚Äôs requirements using semantic similarity and machine learning.

- **Interview Performance Analytics**  
  Integrates facial, vocal, and textual cues (from recorded interviews) to assess communication clarity, confidence, and technical understanding.

- **Upskilling Recommendations**  
  Suggests micro-credentials, Coursera/edX courses, or targeted certifications to close the identified skill gaps.

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Visualizes gap trends, top missing skills, and personalized learning routes through dynamic charts and reports.
